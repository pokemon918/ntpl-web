# NoteAble

## Environment

- For some unknown reason in our babel dependencies, the app does not build on Node versions 12.17 and 12.18 (see card [bug/2844](https://trello.com/c/zfPCTxf4/2844-bug-2844-frontend-project-fail-to-start))

## Development Guidelines

Read the frontend development [GUIDELINES](GUIDELINES.md) to get familiar with our tooling.

## Sharing Local State on Bug Reports

When you are reporting a bug, you can export your local state and share it with the developers. The developers will import that state and try to pick up the investigation from where the issue started with you.

Check out the dedicated documentation of [LOCAL STATE](tools/localstate.md) for details.
